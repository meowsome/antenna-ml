# An Explainable Machine Learning Approach to Antenna Design
### Graduate Research Project Spring 2024

Antenna performance simulations are a task that require a lot of resources, consume a lot of time, and are prone to interruptions. The performance can only be measured for predefined antenna geometries. By applying a machine learning algorithm to a portion of data that has already been generated from simulations, antenna performance can be predicted significantly quicker for any specified antenna geometry. Insights about which geometric parameter had the more siginficant impact on the prediction can be drawn from the model and included in the prediction. Additionally, the model can be reversed so that for a particular form of antenna, an ideal geometry can be predicted that will result in a specified performance.
