# An Explainable Machine Learning Approach to Antenna Design
### Graduate Research Project Spring 2024

Antenna simulations are a task that require a lot of resources, consume a lot of time, and are prone to interruptions. Performance metrics can only be measured for predefined antenna, geometries. By applying a machine learning algorithm to data that has already been generated from simulations of an antenna, performance metrics can be predicted significantly quicker than running full simulations. Insights about which geometric parameter had the most significant impact on the prediction can be drawn from the model and included in the output. Additionally, the model can be reversed so that for a particular form of antenna, an optimal geometry can be produced that will result in a specified performance.
