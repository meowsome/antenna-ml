	abstract = {An efficient multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is described for optimizing a novel spline based printed monopole antenna. The antenna geometry is based on spline outlines. Both radiating element and groundplane are simultaneously optimized by the algorithm. The resulting antenna performance is evaluated. It is shown that the evolutionary algorithm and the spline geometry can be used to efficiently generate ultrawideband antennas on limited computing resources.},
