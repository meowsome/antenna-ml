By combining machine learning (ML) methods, including a convolutional neural network and Gaussian process regression, MLAO-AGD achieves great efficient improvement compared with conventional evolutionary algorithm-assisted antenna geometry design methods. The ML methods are introduced to build surrogate models between the antenna geometry and the antenna performance and then provide predictions of potential designs during optimization. The ML-based surrogate model is iteratively updated by verified optimization results using full-wave simulations. Three antenna design examples, including multiband and broadband antenna element design tasks and a mutual coupling reduction design task, are presented to show the advantages of the proposed MLAO-AGD, which include the convergence speed and antenna performance.},

	abstract = {In this study, we present our findings from investigating the use of a machine learning (ML) technique to improve the performance of Quasi-Yagi–Uda antennas operating in the n78 band for 5G applications. This research study investigates several techniques, such as simulation, measurement, and an RLC equivalent circuit model, to evaluate the performance of an antenna. In this investigation, the CST modelling tools are used to develop a high-gain, low-return-loss Yagi–Uda antenna for the 5G communication system. When considering the antenna’s operating frequency, its dimensions are \$\$\{0.642\}{\textbackslash}lambda \_0{\textbackslash}times \{0.583\}{\textbackslash}lambda \_0\$\$. The antenna has an operating frequency of 3.5 GHz, a return loss of \$\$-43.45\$\$dB, a bandwidth of 520 MHz, a maximum gain of 6.57 dB, and an efficiency of almost 97\%. The impedance analysis tools in CST Studio’s simulation and circuit design tools in Agilent ADS software are used to derive the antenna’s equivalent circuit (RLC). We use supervised regression ML method to create an accurate prediction of the frequency and gain of the antenna. Machine learning models can be evaluated using a variety of measures, including variance score, R square, mean square error, mean absolute error, root mean square error, and mean squared logarithmic error. Among the nine ML models, the prediction result of Linear Regression is superior to other ML models for resonant frequency prediction, and Gaussian Process Regression shows an extraordinary performance for gain prediction. R-square and var score represents the accuracy of the prediction, which is close to 99\% for both frequency and gain prediction. Considering these factors, the antenna can be deemed an excellent choice for the n78 band of a 5G communication system.},

	abstract = {Metamaterial Antenna is a subclass of antennas that makes use of metamaterial to improve performance. Metamaterial antennas can overcome the bandwidth constraint associated with tiny antennas. Machine learning is receiving a lot of interest in optimizing solutions in a variety of areas. Machine learning methods are already a significant component of ongoing research and are anticipated to play a critical role in today’s technology. The accuracy of the forecast is mostly determined by the model used. The purpose of this article is to provide an optimal ensemble model for predicting the bandwidth and gain of the Metamaterial Antenna. Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, K-Neighbors Regressor, and Decision Tree Regressor were utilized as the basic models. The Adaptive Dynamic Polar Rose Guided Whale Optimization method, named AD-PRS-Guided WOA, was used to pick the optimal features from the datasets. The suggested model is compared to models based on five variables and to the average ensemble model. The findings indicate that the presented model using Random Forest results in a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of (0.0102) for bandwidth and RMSE of (0.0891) for gain. This is superior to other models and can accurately predict antenna bandwidth and gain.},

	abstract = {Kernel methods provide a principled approach to nonparametric learning. While their basic implementations scale poorly to large problems, recent advances showed that approximate solvers can efficiently handle massive datasets. A shortcoming of these solutions is that hyperparameter tuning is not taken care of, and left for the user to perform. Hyperparameters are crucial in practice and the lack of automated tuning greatly hinders efficiency and usability. In this paper, we work to fill in this gap focusing on kernel ridge regression based on the Nystr{\textbackslash}"om approximation. After reviewing and contrasting a number of hyperparameter tuning strategies, we propose a complexity regularization criterion based on a data dependent penalty, and discuss its efficient optimization. Then, we proceed to a careful and extensive empirical evaluation highlighting strengths and weaknesses of the different tuning strategies. Our analysis shows the benefit of the proposed approach, that we hence incorporate in a library for large scale kernel methods to derive adaptively tuned solutions.},

	abstract = {In recent years, various methods from the evolutionary computation (EC) field have been applied to electromagnetic (EM) design problems and have shown promising results. However, due to the high computational cost of the EM simulations, the efficiency of directly using evolutionary algorithms is often very low (e.g., several weeks' optimization time), which limits the application of these methods for many industrial applications. To address this problem, a new method, called surrogate model assisted differential evolution for antenna synthesis (SADEA), is presented in this paper. The key ideas are: (1) A Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model is constructed on-line to predict the performances of the candidate designs, saving a lot of computationally expensive EM simulations. (2) A novel surrogate model-aware evolutionary search mechanism is proposed, directing effective global search even when a traditional high-quality surrogate model is not available. Three complex antennas and two mathematical benchmark problems are selected as examples. Compared with the widely used differential evolution and particle swarm optimization, SADEA can obtain comparable results, but achieves a 3 to 7 times speed enhancement for antenna design optimization.},

To solve the multiobjective problem of antenna modeling, the first part of the ANN model involves three parallel and independent branches for S -parameter, gain, and radiation pattern, and the second part outputs a final predicted result. Once the training is completed, the proposed inverse model can provide antenna geometries directly without being repetitively called by an optimization algorithm. Compared with the inverse extreme learning machine and five state-of-art forward models, the proposed model uses a small number of training samples and directly obtains the satisfying values of geometrical variables without any optimization process.},

The DR antenna is built on a 1.6-mm-thick FR-4 substrate with dimensions of 30*50 mm2. The proposed dielectric resonator antenna is made of alumina and is excited using a microstrip feedline of 50 Ω. Because of the hybrid arrangement of cylindrical and rectangular dielectric resonator elements on the FR4 substrate, this proposed structure has improved the radiation mechanism. The antenna design process begins with creating the antenna in the Ansys HFSS EM simulator, which is then optimized using machine learning based on the antenna geometry’s target factors. A data set of 2625 sample data values is generated in HFSS and fed to various machine learning algorithms for further optimization based on data trends. Post-optimization, the antenna design is fabricated and tested. The proposed antenna offers a wide bandwidth of 1.1 GHz between 3.5 and 4.6 GHz and resonates at 3.9 GHz making it suitable for 5G sub-6 GHz IoT applications.},

The development of an optimal antenna design is crucial to attain the required performance and capabilities.

The main objective of this work is to develop an antenna that operates in the THz Band, which is the essential 6G band for the future infrastructure revolution, and to predict and optimize the antenna's return loss using ML models like K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XG-Boost), Decision Tree, and Random Forest and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 3.816.

The proposed AENN is composed of two networks. The first network is used to predict the structural parameters of the antenna, and the second network uses the structural parameters as input to verify the results of the first network. This method only needs a small number of datasets to pretrain the network, and then, through the advanced workflow, while updating the dataset, the two networks can evolve iteratively, and finally, the antenna structural parameters under the expected electromagnetic response can be obtained. Taking two wideband dual-polarized antennas as numerical examples, this method is compared with other advanced antenna optimization methods, and the effectiveness of this method is verified.},

In the inverse modeling of an antenna array, the model inputs are electromagnetic parameters, whereas geometrical or physical parameters are set as the outputs. Due to the nonuniqueness of the inverse problem, it is difficult to directly use ANN for inverse modeling. We are trying to solve this problem utilizing monotonicity. The directional derivatives of the corresponding forward problem are calculated and the derivatives are utilized to determine the monotonicity of training data. Based on the monotonicity, the training data are divided into several groups, which are, respectively, used for training parallel branches of ANN. In this way, valid outputs can be provided without the forward model. Three dipole antenna arrays are utilized as examples to verify the efficiency of the proposed technique.},

During the inverse process, the posterior distribution of the design parameters are reproduced based on the target response, which is especially advantageous in cases where similar design performances can be achieved with different parameter combinations. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated using an inverse design example of substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) filter in D-band.},

	abstract = {on-chip interconnects are very important in both integrated circuits and systems, affecting signal transmission directly. To design the interconnects with better performance, designers usually rely on heuristic methods and even rules of thumb with high labor resources. To alleviate this issue, transfer learning-based deep neural networks (TL-DNNs) are proposed to realize the inverse and fully-automatic design of the on-chip interconnects. Such a TL-DNN-based surrogate model consists of two deep neural networks (DNNs). The first DNN is employed to map the performance parameters to the geometric parameters in the equivalent circuit space, where the trained hyperparameters of the first DNN are transferred to the second DNN model. Furthermore, 300 datasets from the in-house electromagnetic (EM) parallel solver space are generated and used to train the second DNN, with 3000 datasets used for testing. Compared with the DNN-based and deep hybrid neural network (HDNN)-based inverse design methods, the proposed method not only achieves a high testing accuracy (93.67\%), but also requires only 6.15 h of modeling time. In addition, the well-trained model has the ability to achieve the desired design specification within a fraction of a second, compared to the hours–days–weeks of the forward design approach. An elaborate interconnect prototype is fabricated, and its measured results fully satisfy the performance demands. It is expected that the proposed modeling scheme can be used for the design of many interconnects.},

A demonstrated antenna prototype verifies the method's effectiveness and the predicted antenna's performance. The experimental results show that the proposed MIMO-BP method has the advantage in terms of convergence speed (i.e., the total electromagnetic simulated number to obtain the desired design) and time costs, high isolation of better than 40 dB over the bandwidth of 3.47–3.58 GHz, and a maximum gain of 4.3 dBi for both ports, which was obtained in about 22.7 h.

title = {Enhancing Adjoint Optimization-based Photonics Inverse Design with Explainable Machine Learning},
year = {2022},
abstract = {A fundamental challenge in the design of photonic devices, and electromagnetic structures more generally, is the optimization of their overall architecture to achieve a desired response. To this end, topology or shape optimizers based on the adjoint variables method have been widely adopted due to their high computational efficiency and ability to create complex freeform geometries. However, the functional understanding of such freeform structures remains a black box. Moreover, unless a design space of high-performance devices is known in advance, such gradient-based optimizers can get trapped in local minima valleys or saddle points, which limits performance achievable through this inverse design process. To elucidate the relationships between device performance and nanoscale structuring while mitigating the effects of local minima trapping, we present an inverse design framework that combines adjoint optimization, automated machine learning (AutoML), and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Integrated with a numerical electromagnetics simulation method, our framework reveals structural contributions towards a figure-of-merit (FOM) of interest. Through an explanation-based reoptimization process, this information is then leveraged to minimize the FOM further than that obtained through adjoint optimization alone, thus overcoming the optimization's local minima. We demonstrate our framework in the context of waveguide design and achieve between 39% and 74% increases in device performance relative to state-of-the-art adjoint optimization-based inverse design across a range of telecom wavelengths. Results of this work therefore highlight machine learning strategies that can substantially extend and enhance the capabilities of a conventional, optimization-based inverse design algorithm while revealing deeper insights into the algorithm's designs.},

abstract = {A central challenge in the development of nanophotonic structures is identifying the optimal design for a target functionality, and understanding the physical mechanisms that enable the optimized device's capabilities. Previously investigated design methods for nanophotonic structures, including both conventional optimization approaches as well as nascent machine learning (ML) strategies, have made progress, yet they remain 'black boxes' that lack explanations for their predictions. Here we demonstrate that convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained to predict the electromagnetic response of classes of metal-dielectric-metal metamaterials, including complex freeform designs, can be explained to reveal deeper insights into the underlying physics of nanophotonic structures. Using an explainable AI (XAI) approach, we show that we can identify the importance of specific spatial regions of a nanophotonic structure for the presence or lack of an absorption peak. Our results highlight that ML strategies can be used for physics discovery, as well as design optimization, in optics and photonics.},
